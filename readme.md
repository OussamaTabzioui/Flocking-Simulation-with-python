# Flocking Simulation

The **Flocking Simulation** project is a Python-based simulation that models the collective behavior of agents (boids) using principles of flocking. This simulation demonstrates how simple rules can lead to complex group behaviors and emergent patterns.

## Features

- **Boid Behavior:**
  - **Alignment:** Boids align their direction with nearby boids.
  - **Cohesion:** Boids move towards the average position of nearby boids.
  - **Separation:** Boids avoid crowding by maintaining a minimum distance from others.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Boids detect and navigate around obstacles to avoid collisions.

- **Predators:** Introduces predators with enhanced speed and force to challenge the boids.

- **Visualization:** Utilizes `pygame` to render boids, obstacles, and predators with visual effects.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the number of boids, obstacles, predator characteristics, and behavioral rules.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OussamaTabzioui/Flocking-Simulation-with-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Flocking-Simulation-with-python
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python installed, then install `pygame`:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Running the Simulation

1. **Execute the Python script:**

   ```bash
   python flocking_simulation.py
   ```

2. **Observe the simulation:**

   Watch how boids interact with each other and obstacles. Adjust the parameters in the script to experiment with different scenarios.

## Usage

- **Educational Tool:** Learn about emergent behaviors and flocking dynamics.
- **Game Development:** Apply flocking algorithms in games or simulations involving groups of agents.
- **Research:** Explore how different parameters affect the behavior of the flock.
